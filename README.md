Config files for the cool [EditBox](http://editbox.sourceforge.net/) plugin for Eclipse.

Editbox surrounds code blocks with colored boxes, allowing easy and fast parsing of code structure. Any beginner programmer who used BlueJ would recognize the functionality. EditBox has a bunch more cool functionality though.

Original settings placed in `original/`, root dir has my own configs.
